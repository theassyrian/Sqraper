# Sqraper
PHP 8Kun Q post scraper.

When viewing via GitHub view this README.md as RAW for proper formatting.

-----------------

The goal and intent of this project is in short, redundancy and community. As of the date of publishing, as far as I am aware,
there is only one scraper making their data public (thank you Patriot!) so that other sites and apps can use it. In the event
that anything ever happen to that site, it's operator or anything else, well... not putting that into the universe. I can say
single point of failure. The only other site I am aware of that operates their own scraper keeps the data they scrape private
to their internal use, as far as I know anyway.

My hope in this script is a few fold:
	
	1) STRONGLY ENCOURAGED! Every site that uses this or any other scraper place their posts.json file at 
	yoursite.com/data/json/posts.json and their downloaded media (images/videos) at yoursite.com/media/. 
	This way if there is ever any issue of any type (e.g. deplatforming), other sites and apps
	can easily grab the data in a multitude of places. They can't $uicide us all.
	2) Don't just grab the scraper and run and ignore the rest of the community. If you make improvements
	that can help the movement at large, post your updates to the GitHub. WARNING though. Please don't change
	the posts.json format... we all need to retain backward compatibility.
	3) Be free to share on your site, or at least with others you know that are capable of running a site and/or
	scraper, that you are using Sqraper and where they can get it. Let's not be selfish. At the very least make
	your scraped data available to others. This is not about one person or site, it's about "we the people".
	4) Perhaps in comments of this GitHub or somewhere else reliable people can post a list of sites that are
	serving up the data.
	5) If you find bugs and correct them, make improvements, etc., contribute your changes back to the Git.
	Don't be "that guy".
	6) Perhaps not a bad idea to clone this Git elsewhere, or at least periodically download it for safe keeping.
	I'm not looking for massive credit or to make a name for myself, however, give credit where credit is due. 
	By license, don't just take it, hack a few changes and call it your own. Please leave the
	credit in the source code. Don't be a d___.
	... long story short, not rocket science, let's work together as a team. WWG1WGA.

This script is NOT for novices. Basic PHP understanding required. I CAN NOT provide support. Maybe from time to time
I can pipe in. However, I am buried as it is. Plus, I am not a PHP expert. This is only my 3rd PHP project ever. Those
more experienced can maybe take the lead and help others. Community.

CONFIGURATION ITEM EXPLAINATIONS:

As of version 1.2.0, the previous STRING type configuration item "qTrip" is now obsolete. It has been replaced with an
ARRAY type configuration item named "qTrips".

  qTrips:
    Type: Array
    Default: [
      "!!mG7VJxZNCI"
    ],
    Q's current trip code. When Q changes trips, be sure the sqraper has downloaded all posts with the previous
    trip code first. Then change the configuration file to Q's new trip code to start pulling posts from the
    new trip.

bogusTrips:
    Type: Array
    Default: [],
    When the script sees a post from the "name" Q, it will display the post and trip so you can confirm if Q has
    started using a new trip. In most cases it is just a knucklhead. In these cases if you want to block detection
    of that false trip you can add it to bogusTrips. You can also just let it eventually fade away as well. The
    dudes will tired and run up from the basement for momma's cookies.
    
  boards:
    Type: Array
    Default: [
      "qresearch"
    ]
    All lower case. Enter the one or more boards Q is dropping on. Example: "qresearch","projectdcomms". When Q
    has a PRIVATE BOARD that only Q can post on, at times Q may initially post as Anonymous WITHOUT a trip code.
    If you would like to pick these posts up also, place a ^ at the end of the board name. Example: "projectdcomms^".
    CAUTION: Do NOT use ^ on a public board!

  domain8Kun:
    Type: String
    Default: "8kun.top"
    This is only used if "useLoki" is false, which causes sqraping over the normal Internet (which at this time is
    not possible due to the DDoS protection 8kun has in place). If sqraping over Internet, you enter the domain to
    scrape (without any leading https:// or trailing /).
    
  domain8KunForLinks:
    Type: String
    Default: "8kun.top"
    All links within the posts.json file to 8kun will be generated with this domain. Do not enter any leading
    https:// or trailing /. Examples: "8kun.net", "8kun.top", etc. WARNING. Once the posts are generated in the
    posts.json file, they are generated. Therefore, this setting only is applied to newly added posts. You may want
    to consider just using "8kun.net" and then do a search and replace in the user facing interface to switch it
    to the current 8kun flavor of the week :).
      
  useLoki:
    Type: Boolean
    Default: true
    If true, causes the sqraper to scrape for new Q over the Loki network (uses "lokiKun" URL setting"). If false,
    causes the sqraper to scrape new Q over the normal Internet (uses "domain8Kun" setting).
    
  lokiKun:
    Type: String
    Default: "http://pijdty5otm38tdex6kkh51dkbkegf31dqgryryz3s3tys8wdegxo.loki"
    Simply the fully qualified URL to 8kun over LokiNet with no trailing /.
    
  useTor:
    Type: Boolean    
    Default: false
    If true, causes sqraper to scrape for new Q over the Tor network (uses "torKun" URL setting).
    See TOR-Notes.md for setup instructions.
  
  torKun:
    Type: String
    Default: "http://www.jthnx5wyvjvzsxtu.onion"
    Simply the fully qualified URL to 8kun over Tor with no trailing /.

  saveRemoteFilesToLocal:
    Type: Boolean
    Default: true
    Saves all JSON files scraped from 8kun to your local drive. This can be helpful after the fact for debugging
    with "readFromLocal8KunFiles". It can also be useful if you ever need to reference older 8kun files since they
    seem to cease to be available after a day or so.
    
  readFromLocal8KunFiles:
    Type: Boolean
    Default: false
    Only used if "saveRemoteFilesToLocal" has been previously enabled and files exist. It is generally used (seldom)
    for in-depth debugging.
    
  sleepBetweenNewQPostChecks:
    Type: Integer
    Default: 150
    The time in seconds to wait between checking for new posts. I suggest you don't get too greedy and chew up 8kun
    resources any more than need be. Let's be respectful. 150 is every 2 and half minutes.
    
  offPeakSleepBetweenNewQPostChecks:
    Type: Integer
    Default: 300
    The time in seconds to wait between checking for new posts during non-peak times (2AM-9AM).
    
  productionPostsJSONFilename:
    Type: String
    Default: "posts.json"
    This is the filename to be used for posts both on your local computer as well as the filename that will be uploaded
    if you are using the FTP upload option.
    
  productionJSONFolder:
    Type: String
    Default: "json/"
    The folder on your local computer where the master "posts.json" (or whatever is defined in "productionPostsJSONFilename")
    is stored and updated.
    
  productionMediaFolder:
    Type: String
    Default: "media/"
    The folder on your local computer where images/videos referenced in scraped posts are saved to. If empty then media
    will not be downloaded and thus will not be able to be uploaded via FTP if you use the FTP upload options.
    
  ftpUploadJSON:
    Type: Boolean
    Default: false
    Whether or not to upload the "posts.json" file via FTP to a remote server when it is updated.
  
  ftpUploadJSONFolder:
    Type: String
    Default: "/data/json/"
    The folder on the remote server where the "posts.json" will be FTP uploaded to.
    
  ftpUploadMedia:
    Type: Boolean
    Default: false
    Whether or not to upload images/videos via FTP to a remote server when they are found in newly scraped posts.
    Also requires "productionMediaFolder".

  ftpUploadMediaFolder:
    Type: String
    Default: "/media/"
    The folder on the remote server where images/videos will be FTP uploaded to.
    
  ftpServer:
    Type: String
    Default: "ftp.yourserver.com"
    Self explanitory.

  ftpLoginID:
    Type: String
    Default: "your_user_name"
    Self explanitory.
    
  ftpPassword:
    Type: String
    Default: "your_password"
    Self explanitory
    
  productionMediaURL:
    Type: String
    Default: "https://yourserver.com/media/"
    When media (images/videos) are present in a scraped post, this is the URL that will be prepended to the filename
    in the posts.json file. It should be a valid URL on your web server.
  
  maxDownloadAttempts:
    Type: Integer
    Default: 10
    Max number of times to retry on a failed JSON download from 8kun.

  pauseBetweenDownloadAttempts:
    Type: Integer
    Default: 1
    Delay in seconds between each retry on a JSON download from 8kun.  

-----------------

PREREQUISITES:

You MUST have PHP installed. I have tested the script with PHP on both Windows 10 as well as Linux Ubuntu Server LTS.

As of the writing of this, you will have to install LOKINET from https://loki.network/ and run this script with "lokiKun"
set to true. This is because 8kun DDoS protection is blocking scripts.

The first time you run the script it will create the configuration file "sqraper_config.json" in the same folder as
sqraper.php lives in. You can then edit the file to set your configuration (or you can create it from scratch prior).
Once the sqraper is running you can change "sqraper_config.json" anytime to make config changes and have them applied
to the already running script since the config file is re-read at the end of each loop.

It is imperative that your "posts.json" file is up-to-date before the Sqraper finds any new posts since it adds newly found
posts onto the existing "posts.json" file. You can download a copy from one of the following URLs (amongst other places)
and place it in the folder you have configured for "productionJSONFolder". Alteratively you can consider running the
included "SeedData.php" script.

https://qalerts.app/data/json/posts.json
https://qanon.pub/data/json/posts.json
https://keybase.pub/qntmpkts/data/json/posts.json

You will also more than likely need to grab all of the images contained in posts thus far from a site operator who
already has them all, or you can find them via the links below. Alteratively you can consider running the
included "SeedData.php" script.

https://keybase.pub/qntmpkts/data/media/
https://qalerts.net/media/

SeedData.php: This script downloads the latest "posts.json" file and all media files from QAlerts.app and places them in
the appropriate folders of your Sqraper installation based on the "productionJSONFolder" and "productionMediaFolder" settings
in your "sqraper_config.json".

Special thanks to "qntmpkts" for all of his work compiling posts since the very beginning! He has been a pioneer in
the movement to say the least. 

To have the script send files via FTP you will in most cases need to add (or uncomment) the FTP extension to your PHP.ini
file. This varies depending on your operating system and PHP version. If you run into issues or questions just google it.
Here are some basics:

WINDOWS 10:

  extension=php_openssl.dll
  extension=php_ftp.dll

LINUX:

  Depending on your Linux version these may already be enabled. For example: On the "Ubunti Server LTS" machine I am
  running the script on, all that was needed was enabled by default. For standard desktop Ubuntu versions it is my
  guess you will need to enable the extensions.
  
  extension=ftp
  
  You may also have to add sockets. For some older versions it may be ftp.so and sockets.so. The script should
  throw an error and let you know if something required has not been enabled. Just google it. I am far from fluent
  in Linux.

-----------------

RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

WARNING: Even though this script is a PHP script, it is NOT intended to be run as a web page. Due to the fact that the
sqraper_config.json configuration file lives in the same folder as the script, if you enter your FTP credentials, not
to mention path info in the config file, anyone can access and view your config file via a browser. Bad times.

It is assume you have PHP installed and configured, and that you also have LOKINET from https://loki.network/ installed
and connected.

  WINDOWS: Open a command prompt (cmd) and type "PHP Sqraper.php" and press enter.
  
  LINUX: Open a terminal sessions and type "PHP Sqraper.php" and press enter.

To exit the script just press CTRL + C.
